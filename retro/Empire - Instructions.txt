Too hard to read/use so I used TRS32 to copy & paste them into this text file.

Hello!     Welcome to  E M P I R E . . .                      
                                                                
Imagine yourself to be the ruler of a small, unimportant piece  
of European land way back in the medieval ages. Your country is 
beset by many problems - no industry, little trade, small army, 
underpopulation, angry neighbors, plague, and all the other     
day-to-day problems a capable leader must learn to face. Am-    
bitious by necessity, you must aquire land, capital, and an     
army just to survive. Because of the short lifetimes back then, 
you'll have only a limited amount of time to build your coun-   
try into an empire.                                             
                                                                
  Competent rule will gradually be rewarded with lofty titles - 
Knight, Prince, King, and finally  -- Emperor --

- - -
   Sounds easy?  Then consider this - five other city-states are 
also struggling to become the emperor, and they don't just in-  
tend to passively watch you win. They control armies which can  
attack at a moments notice, and perhaps devastate your country. 
They control the grain market, and if you think OPEC is bad,    
just wait and see how scarce and expensive grain can become.    
  Of course, a competent ruler could make a killing on the      
grain market. With proper planning, your harvests should be     
plentiful. You could solve overpopulation problems by raising a 
large army to be killed off in battle.                          
  Nevertheless, your overiding concern should be lebensraum -   
living room. There is only a limited amount of land to be con-  
quered. If you can defeat the barbarian hordes, and the well-   
trained standing armies of the other nations, and then defeat   
their peasant militias, perhaps you may attain the well deser-  
ved title of Emperor.

Taxes:                                                          
  The customs tax applies only to immigrants to your nation.    
Often, lower customs tax means more immigrants.                 
  The sales tax is closely intertwined into your capitalist     
economy. While it has the potential of raising lots of money,   
overly high taxes tend to stifle industrial profits.            
  Income taxes are paid by all inhabitants and industry. Again, 
lower income tax often means increased industrial output.       
                                                                
  You have the option each year to invest your earnings in      
different types of trade and industry. In the years to follow,  
these investments, if managed correctly, will more than pay     
for themselves.                                                 
                                                                
- - -                                                                
Types of investments:                                           
                                                                
  Marketplaces are a relatively cheap investment that are quite 
profitable because they encourage the formation of a middle     
class - the merchants. And, as you are probably aware, the      
middle class pays an inordinate share of taxes.                 
  Grain mills are necessary to process the harvest, and con-    
sequently, usually do quite well when there is a large harvest. 
  Foundries are necessary for the creation of large armies.     
Several of them will allow you to equip a much larger army      
than otherwise.                                                 
  Shipyards have the greatest profit potential of all invest-   
ments. Because of a larger volume of orders during good wea-    
ther, there is often a better return during these years.

- - -
  Armies are never a profitable investment. Besides costing     
a large initial investment, they also cost a lot to maintain    
and train. In addition, they also require a greater fraction    
of the harvest than serfs.                                      
  Of course, one should give himself the luxury of building a   
palace. What else could distinguish an emperor from all the     
other kings with their castles, than a palace? Also, with a     
palace, your country will begin to attract more nobles.         
                                                                
Other general hints:                                            
  You always lose 10% as a brokerage fee when dealing on the    
grain market. When you sell your grain at different prices,     
the market price is the weighted average of the sales prices    
(this helps to prevent large yearly price fluctuations). To     
prevent those unscrupulous rulers who try to use the market as  
a method to avoid the rats, you can't buy back your own grain.  

- - -
Also, leave a portion of your grain reserve for planting for    
next year's harvest.                                            
Often, it is beneficial to feed your people much more than they 
require. Immigrants are usually attracted to a prosperous nat-  
ion, and sometimes, even merchants and nobles move in.          
                                                                                                                                
  Up to six people can play this game. Rulers not played by     
humans will be played by your TRS-80, with its playing abil-    
ity based on the average of the human players.
